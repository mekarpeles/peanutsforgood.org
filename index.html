      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
	In four words: <strong>We sell peanut butter</strong>.

      <p>
	We find affordable ways to produce fresh, healthy, convenient,
	and delicious homemade peanut products which you can feel proud to
	support.
      </p>

      <p>
	<span class="highlight">Our mission is our
	  <strong>community</strong>:</span> We're following a
	"<a href="https://www.toms.com/one-for-one-en/">Tom's One for
	One</a>" model where the price you pay for a jar of peanut
	butter also funds a second jar for SF's needy. As often as we
	can, we'll turn this fresh peanut butter into delicious
	PB&amp;J's and personally distribute them to the needy in our
	community.
      </p>
      
      <p><span class="highlight">Our first product is <strong>PowerButter</strong>:</span> homemade,
	healthy, freshly-crushed peanut butter made exactly the way you

      <p>
	As athletes, we care what we put into our bodies. We also know
	how hard it is to maintain a healthy diet and to find
	balanced, healthful foods. Our products are <strong>made
	to-order</strong> with options to add protein, vitamins,
	and natural flavors to match your tastes and give you
	confidence about your diet. <strong>Prefer no sugar?</strong>
	No problem, that should be a <strong>choice you
	control</strong>.

      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>	
	The story of <strong>peanutsforgood.org</strong> begins with <a href="https://mek.fyi/">Mek</a>, a Bay Area competitive rock climber who was running late for an outdoor climbing trip. After waking up just ten minutes before the scheduled departure time, he frantically searched for the first quick, nutritious snack he could bring with him: Skippy Peanut Butter and tortilla wraps. His climbing foodie friend all teasted him mercilessly at lunch time and joked he should try to get sponsored by Skippy Peanut Butter. After all, when there's Patagonia, REI, and Clif bars, how many climbers could possibly be competing for sponsorships by a peanut butter company? Well, Mek was game to try -- it sounded like fun.
      </p>

      <p>For over two years, Mek trained and he trained, climbing thousands of boulders and tagging @Skippy on all of his facebook climbing videos.</p>

      <p>It was no use, Mek wasn't strong enough. And so he decided to
      write a humble plea for Skippy's support:</p>

      <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmichael.karpeles%2Fposts%2F10103386808360760&amp;width=500&amp;show_text=true&amp;appId=399865573399091&amp;height=257" width="500" height="257" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

      <p><strong>And it worked!</strong></p>

      <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmichael.karpeles%2Fposts%2F10103418330500140&amp;width=500" width="500" height="613" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

      <p>SKIPPY gave Mek 3 free jars of peanut butter. "How many people", he wondered, "do you think one could feed with a jar of peanut butter? I bet there are a lot of people who could use a free pb&amp;j more than I do". And so one sunny Saturday, Mek went around the Mission, SF, distributing sandwiches to anyone who was hungry. He didn't make it 2 blocks before running out of almost 15 sandwiches and juice boxes.</p>

      <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmichael.karpeles%2Fposts%2F10103448623876970&amp;width=500" width="500" height="522" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

      <p>And just like that, the fun was over. Mek had run out of peanut butter and our story comes to an end. Or story would have ended, had not  <a href="https://rubin.io/">Jeremy Rubin</a> came to the rescue, donating 2 more 48oz jars of peanut butter to power another round of 30 PB&amp;J for SF's hungry!</p>
      
      <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10103456641509570%26set%3Da.828052788480.2295309.6913415%26type%3D3&amp;width=500" width="500" height="595" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

      <p>
	That's when it hit us, we don't have to run out of peanut butter. Jeremy planted the idea, "maybe u should start a PB company. Do a jar for jar thing. like toms".</p>

      <p>And after weeks of research and user-studies, peanutsforgood.org was born.</p>
